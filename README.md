### Topic: "Cryptocurrency Analysis using Visualization"

### Objective
Objective of this project is to analyze cryptocurrencies using visualization techniques. This application introduces the user to the cryptocurrency dataset. It tries to identify the various parameters of cryptocurrencies and provide a way to visualize those parameters to understand the behaviour of the cryptocurrencies in the current and the past market. This inturn provides some amount of guidance for the users to make informed decisions while investing in Cryptocurrencies. To analyze Cryptocurrency data, in this project I am using Tableau desktop [6] and D3.js [7] as visualization tools. I am planning to create some Stories [9] and Dashboards [8] in Tableau to analyze both historical and current crypto data.


Using these visualization techniques, I will attempt the following questions: 
1) Visualize Cryptocurrency data based on market parameters
2) Identify Dominant cryptocurrencies in the current and past market
3) Trend Analysis of different Cryptocurrencies over the years
4) Global Crypto adoption
5) Visualization Summary and Conclusion
